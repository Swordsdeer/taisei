_("Divine Correction for Outliers")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("The decision to arrange a character’s existing theme or to come up with something entirely new is difficult and likely one ZUN himself struggles with.\n\nI know my strengths lie in the latter, which ultimately resulted in the stormy composition usually heard at the top of the tower, but Iku has such an interesting original theme I had to at least accept the challenge.\n\nUltimately, I can’t decide if I did the original justice with this one or not, but I know it holds a special place in my heart.")
_("Existential Field")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("The staff roll theme.\n\nA sense of inspiration and the future is maintained from Excitation Field.\n\nOne that’s a lot gentler than a thunderstorm… perhaps a bit more like a rainbow.")
_("Dream Cycle")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("The ending’s theme.\n\nIn summation, class, what have we learned today?\n\nKnowledge is the forbidden fruit; from it stem the powers of light and darkness. But it’s about time the protagonists have had a snack.")
_("Delta Conclusion")
_("RickyRister")
_("Taisei Project")
_("Gahhhhhh why am *I* the one who has to name this, Akari?!\nEvery song I’ve ever made was named by the recipient.\nYou’re putting too much pressure on meeeeeee.\n\n*Ahem* So yeah, it’s a player’s score theme.\nIt incorporates bits from the final boss theme and Kanako’s theme, just like any other PS theme.\nWhat else were you expecting?")
_("Unsettling Knowledge")
_("jneen-collective")
_("Taisei Project")
_("The intro cutscene theme.\n\nCrackles and flashes of otherworldly knowlege. Maybe a bit sinister, unclear whether to be trusted.")
_("Delta Concision")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("An introduction to the occident.\n\nMany paths branch from one. Echoes from across the sea yield a new adventure.")
_("Logic Bombardier")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("A secret theme for a most beloved character…\n\nI wanted to play with the concept of Scuttle’s motif as heard in the tunnel of light and try to apply it to a full-length song.\n\nThe results were interesting! Her theme is as much an experiment as her existence.\n\nSupposing she were to appear as a boss, I think it might sound different given a different role in the incident.")
_("The Fog Invites Unseen Mischief")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("The first stage’s theme.\n\nA relaxing mist illustrated with subdued instruments. Familiar shadows stir trouble just out of view. Ripples of times past dance across Misty Lake.")
_("An Impish Reflection on the Water")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("Cirno’s theme.\n\nShe’s feeling just as brave this time around, and acting a fair bit stronger.\n\nHowever, she’s really just a minor annoyance, cold and brittle. The protagonists brush off her pranks and move on.")
_("Treasure the Wager, Treasure the Odds")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("The second stage’s theme.\n\nFor such a calm and serene path, there sure are a lot of troublemakers — a deceptively fast-paced theme, to be sure. One excitable example makes a brief appearance. The rhythm of this theme is meant to make you feel lucky.")
_("The Cheerful Presence of a Dark God")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("Hina Kagiyama’s theme.\n\nThis time, it’s all up to chance.\n\nIt’s a little merciful sometimes, but you still have to do your best, no matter what. Gambling might be a poor stress-reliever…")
_("Fizeau’s Finding ~ Lightray Vector")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("The third stage’s theme.\n\nIt’s usually tricky to see in the dark. It pulls you in, engulfs you, like a sense-smothering flame. But this time, it might be best to protect your eyes. A fluttering little bug feels most at home in the dead of night, and most alive in a sea of light.")
_("Lightningbug ~ Lightning Heart")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("Wriggle Nightbug’s theme.\n\nA very motivated bug. She’s at the top of the world! — No, someone else is, she’s in the middle of a tunnel. Regardless, she knows she can do anything if she puts her mind to it, right?\n\nSounds a little “beach”-like in the introduction…")
_("Evidence of Ki Domestication")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("The fourth stage’s theme.\n\nAnother trip back into the orient… like a pendulum swinging back and forth.\n\nThis theme draws inspiration from a particularly elusive musician living on the other side of the sea known for the Chinese influences in his music.\n\nSmells like rust.")
_("Marginal Red ~ The Red Word")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("Kurumi’s theme.\n\nOld faces and new dreams. She’s taken a new residence, something a little more comfortable than a Lake of Blood, but this confrontation is anything but. A mix of fears make the walls feel like they’re closing in.")
_("Speak Not Falsely ~ Excitation Field")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("The fifth stage’s theme.\n\nAnd back again… how did that song go? “No reason to get excited…”\n\nBut in honesty, this is a combination of Eastern and Western influences now. If it were like a pendulum up to this point, then this theme is like an oscillating electric current.\n\nThose who climb risk a long fall, so look to the top and don’t make a single dishonest step.")
_("A Prayer Worth Three Hundred Coulombs")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("Iku Nagae’s theme.\n\nThis song went through the wringer. Perhaps that’s appropriate for what the protagonists have to do. Imagine climbing a tower in the middle of a vicious thunderstorm and try not to feel exhausted.\n\nIku provides the first tribulation.")
_("Summit of Revelations")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("The sixth stage’s theme.\n\nAt the top of the tower, you can see the world, and at what risk?\n\nA grand architectural marvel may take thousands of years to complete… this song was no different! But the end result feels like a great discovery.")
_("Cosmological Battle ~ The Vacuum Catastrophe")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("Elly’s first theme.\n\nAn old friend. I always found myself inspired by the idea of a completely inconsequential character from forgotten times climbing to great heights after fading into obscurity.\n\nShe may have been a lowly gate guard the last time you saw her, but the apple’s fallen on her head. She’s a guard of a different kind of gate now.")
_("Deified Emergent Property ~ Ambivalent Soul")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("Elly’s second theme.\n\nThe most frightening and wondrous powers of the world remain just out of reach to our mortal minds. But a couple of truly brilliant people just may have found the bridge between our world and theirs…\n\nElly is a new person now, so an arrange wouldn’t speak the truth.")
_("Immutable Truth")
_("Tuck V")
_("Taisei Project")
_("Elly’s last spell.\n\nThe most ambitious and impossibly necessary tasks must encapsulate absolutely everything. Many think of science as a body of knowledge, a sealed bubble, within which all “great discoveries” have already been achieved, but the contrary could not be more true. Science is an unending series of dark curtains to pull back, each new finding more magnificent and imperceptible than the last.")
